\section{INTRODUCTION}

\section*{SPRINT 1}
\subsection*{Attendees:}
Kayla-Jade Butkow, Jared Ping, Lara Timm, Matt van Rooyen
\subsection*{Agenda:} 
To critically analyse the sprint. Calculate the sprint velocity.

\subsection*{Minutes of meeting:}
Start date: 24/04/2018 \\
Start time: 19:00

\subsubsection*{What went right:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We met our expected deadlines, both individually and as a team
	\item Collaborative work was performed smoothly
	\item All developer stories assigned to the sprint milestone were completed
	\item An efficient code review process was created and maintained for the duration of the sprint
	\item Minimal variation between developers 
	\item The use of daily stand-ups to track sprint progress
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{What went wrong:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The collaborative components of the agile development process resulted in unexpected delays
	\item Logic based pull requests were opened without any tests
	\item A branch was merged before suggested changes were made
	\item Poor communication when developer required assistance
	\item Only unit tests were implemented 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{What needs improvement:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Weekly meeting to improve scrum tactics. This will ensure that all team members are well versed in agile techniques to accommodate a more streamlined process
	\item A minimum of one tests must be implemented for each logic based developer story 
	\item Implementation of tests from all levels of the test pyramid
	\item More rigorous pull request reviews. Any changes should be required, rather than suggested
	\item Improve structure of daily stand-ups to ensure that assistance is readily available 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Velocity:}
Each developer story was assigned an effort rating between 1 and 10. Using these efforts, the sprint velocity was calculated to be 49. The ideal velocity for the next sprint is therefore 49.
