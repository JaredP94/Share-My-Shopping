Note that this requires you to be running a local MySQL database which can be connected to the application by referring to the relevant wiki page [here](https://github.com/JaredP94/Share-My-Shopping/wiki/Configuring-MySQL-for-Local-Dev-vs-Azure-Deployment).

The user story map used in the project can be accessed [here](https://sharemyshopping.storiesonboard.com/m/guidemap). GitHub's Projects was used to manage collaborative development
